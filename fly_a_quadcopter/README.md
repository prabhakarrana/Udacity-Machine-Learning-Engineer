# Teach A Quadcopter To Fly

In this project, we will design an agent to fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm. Basic controls are
like take off, glide,reach a destination and landing.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Reinforcement Learning, Keras or Tensorflow, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients or DDPG
