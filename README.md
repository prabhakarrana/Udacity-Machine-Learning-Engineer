**Identifying dog breeds**

Algorithm: OpenCV, Convolutional Neural Networks: ResNet-50, VGG-16, VGG-19, Inception and Xception

Given an image of a dog, the algorithm identified an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code identifies the resembling dog breed. Used transfer learning on several CNN architectures, finally picking one which yielded 84% accuracy. 

**Finding Donors for CharityML**

Algorithm: Gradient Boosting Ensemble, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines

Data Set: Census Income Data Set - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income

Employed several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Along with other features, this can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.


**Fly a Quadcopter**

Algorithm: reinforcement learning,Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients or DDPG, Keras or TensorFlow.

DDPG It is actually an actor-critic method, but the key idea is that the underlying policy function used is deterministic in nature, with some noise added in externally to produce the desired stochasticity in actions taken.In this project, i have to design an agent that can fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm
